# Testing

`pnpm test` runs two layers, in order; either failing fails the command and the CI job.

1. `pnpm test:unit`: Vitest, every package plus `tools/harness/test` (comparator, golden store, budgets, bundle size,
   model-view helpers).
2. `pnpm test:browser`: Playwright in a pinned headless Chromium on software WebGL (SwiftShader), `tools/harness`.

Run `pnpm browsers` once per machine (and after a Playwright version bump) to install the browser. Playwright is pinned
to an exact version in `tools/harness/package.json`, which pins the Chromium revision.

## Browser tests

Fixtures in `tools/harness/fixtures` are self-contained WebGL2 pages served by a local Vite server on
`127.0.0.1:<port>`. The port is `MS_HARNESS_PORT`, else a stable per-checkout port in 4410..4909 derived from the harness
directory, so two worktrees can test at once; a server already on that port is never reused. A fixture publishes `window.__msFixture`; the spec waits for `ready`, reads the drawing buffer with
`gl.readPixels`, flips it, and encodes a PNG in Node. Every golden render asserts a SwiftShader renderer, so a local GPU
never produces or checks a golden. Every spec uses the shared `test` from `src/harnessTest.ts`, which fails any request off the fixture origin on any page,
and every `openFixture` asserts SwiftShader. Fixture
image code uses no clock or random source (lint rule; timing lives in `fixtures/src/bench.ts` only).

## Goldens

- Location `tools/harness/goldens/`, one file per name for every platform.
- Names: `name.png` for raster fixtures, `name.s<seed>.n<samples>.png` for path-traced ones. Seed (0..2^32-1) and
  sample count (1..4096) are part of the spec; rendering another seed or count fails the comparison.
- Comparison: pixelmatch (perceptual, anti-aliased pixels counted) with `threshold 0.1` and `maxDiffRatio 0.001`, plus a global
  check, `maxMeanDelta 1`: the mean absolute channel delta over the whole image, in 0..255 levels. pixelmatch alone
  ignores a uniform shift of up to about 25 levels; the mean catches exposure-like changes. A failure writes
  `<name>-actual.png`, `<name>-expected.png` and `<name>-diff.png` into the per-test subfolder of
  `tools/harness/test-results/` (the path is in the failure message); CI uploads `test-results/` as the
  `browser-test-results` artefact.
- What fails for a wrong sample count: the fixture counts the draws it really made and the spec rejects a count that
  differs from the request (`assertSampleCount`); for the same seed, 63 or 65 samples instead of 64 also fail the
  comparison by themselves, with 0 differing pixels but a mean delta of 1.40..1.42 levels against the limit of 1 (seed 8:
  12.8, 32 samples: 9.0). The 63/65 margin is small; do not raise `maxMeanDelta` without a replacement check.
- A missing golden fails the test, and the message names the spec file of the failing test as the update pattern. Goldens are written only by `pnpm golden:update [spec file pattern]`, for
  example `pnpm golden:update golden.spec` (Playwright `--update-snapshots=changed`; the pattern selects spec files, not
  golden names); the command is refused when `CI` is set. Review every changed image as an image before
  committing.
- Data goldens (JSON file snapshots of loader output, `__goldens__/*.json` next to the Vitest tests) are written only by
  `pnpm golden:update:data [test file pattern]` (`vitest run --update`); review the JSON diff before committing.
- A per-golden tolerance override (`threshold`, `maxDiffRatio`, `maxMeanDelta`, each range-checked) needs a non-empty `reason` in the spec, and GPU-variance evidence (the CI diff
  artefact) in the commit.

## Realtime renderer goldens

`e2e/realtime.spec.ts` renders `fixtures/rt.html` (the realtime renderer on SwiftShader, 256 x 256, no clock or
random source; partial alpha on the fallback path uses an integer hash). Scenes and camera presets live in
`fixtures/src/rtScenes.ts`, so the path-tracer fixture can render the same scene and camera for a paired golden. The
fixture models in `fixtures/models/` are ours (CC0, `LICENSE` there); `rt-showcase.bbmodel` has an atlas whose 6 x 6
face rectangles sit in a ring of magenta sentinel texels, opaque, cut-out and 50 % texels, a zero-thickness sprite,
two overlapping partial-alpha planes in different meshes, rotated and mirrored face UVs and a 64 x 64 brick face.

- Goldens: `rt-turntable-y000`, `-y030`, `-y060`, `-y090` (perspective 35°, pitch 20°), `rt-iso` (orthographic
  isometric), `rt-closeup` (half the fit distance, atlas texels about 28 px), `rt-far` (three times the fit
  distance, brick texels about 0.45 px), `rt-fallback` (no-float path), `rt-fit-flat-cube` (frame-to-fit of a plate
  with zero height). Default tolerance.
- Bleeding: no turntable frame has a pixel whose red and blue both exceed green by more than 24 levels (the magenta
  sentinel after lighting and AgX). Without the face-rectangle clamp the 0° frame has 441 such pixels.
- Shimmer: between yaw 30° and 30.25°, the share of pixels changing by more than 64 levels must be at most half of
  the same share with nearest sampling (`aa=0`), in the `far` and `closeup` framings.
- Order independence: reversing the mesh order gives a byte-identical image on the float path and on the fallback.
- A cut-out texel over the backdrop shows exactly the backdrop colour.
- Context loss through `WEBGL_lose_context`: the image after the restore matches `rt-turntable-y030`, without a
  reload or a page error.
- Device pixel ratio 2 doubles the backing store; an element resize reallocates and keeps the projection unstretched.
- Sides: the zero-height plate (two coincident single-sided faces) seen from above shows its grass face, from below
  only its stone face, on both paths.
- Scene-format rule against the model-view fixture (`look=model-view` uses the fixture's camera, so its `probes` fall
  on the same pixels; `depth=framed` clips at 20..120, `depth=inside` at far × 1e-4..120 like a camera inside the
  bounding sphere, which switches the renderer to the exact depth key; `rt.depthKeyMode()` is asserted), on the
  float path and the fallback: `alpha-plane` (opaque texel, transparent texel showing the ground, double-sided back
  showing the mirrored texel), `render-order` (a scene with render orders, so always the exact key: the coincident
  horizontal pairs split along different diagonals, gap pairs at 2 × TIE where the nearer shows and tie pairs at
  0.5 × TIE where `in_front` shows), and `coincident-double` (order 0, so the raster key when framed;
  `look=above|below|grazing-above|grazing-below`: of two coincident double-sided quads split along different
  diagonals the one facing the camera wins, at about 8° with no pixel of the other colour; a single-sided quad seen
  from behind shows the backdrop).
- Closed double-sided boxes against the same boxes without their hidden faces (`closed-cube` / `closed-cube-open`, and
  `step` / `step-open`: a tall box beside a low one, with a T-junction and a hidden face coincident with a visible one
  facing the other way; visible faces red, hidden blue): not one pixel may differ, on float and fallback, with the
  exact key inside the sphere and from render order 1 (`-order` scenes), seen from `cube`, `cube-grazing-1` (the east
  face about 1° from edge-on) and `cube-grazing-5`; the raster key from `cube` (its grazing MSAA deviation is
  documented in realtime-renderer.md). The raster back pass at `polygonOffset(1, 1)` differs in 117 pixels.
- Render-order tie at sample level: a red `in_front` quad over a coincident blue default quad split along the other
  diagonal (`tie-pair`) against the red quad alone (`tie-single`): not one pixel may differ, exact key, float and
  fallback, seen `above`, `grazing-above` (about 8°) and `model-view`; the double-sided pair seen `below` and
  `grazing-below` ties two back sides (without the shared-edge flags 1–124 pixels differ); and at device pixel ratio 2
  in a non-square 768 x 512 viewport (the exact key's ray uses the viewport the passes draw into; a drawing buffer
  smaller than the canvas cannot be produced in this harness).
- Texel alpha bytes in the shaders: a 16 x 16 quad with `fixtures/models/rt-alpha-ramp.png` (white texels whose alpha
  byte is their index, CC0) seen square on, `aa=0`, float and fallback: under blend 0.01 exactly the bytes 0–2 show
  only the backdrop, under mask 128/255 the bytes 0–127, under opaque none (so the cutoff byte and the bytes below it,
  254 and 255 run through `texelAlpha.glsl`).
- Float targets the driver rejects at a new size (`breakFramebuffers()` makes every framebuffer report incomplete)
  switch the renderer to the no-float path; `capabilities.path` reports it.
- Hostile textures (corrupt bytes rejected at the header, a valid header with scrambled image data that fails to
  decode, missing, header size lying, a 16384 x 16384 PNG header behind a declared 16 x 16,
  over `maxTextureSide`) draw a placeholder with a warning, the oversized one without being decoded; two quick `setScene` calls show only the second; `dispose()` (also during decoding) leaves no live WebGL
  object or open ImageBitmap (counted with `track=1`).
- Framing: the fit and isometric views keep a 2 px backdrop border around the model.

For a manual run on real hardware open `rt.html?scene=bench&size=512&fps=1`: it draws continuously and shows the
median frame work (draw until the GPU finished) and display interval over the last 120 frames, with the renderer
string.

## Path-tracer goldens

Fix the seed, the sample count, the resolution and the camera. The accumulation stops after exactly N samples, never
after a time. Random numbers come from a seeded integer hash, never `Math.random`.

## Model-view fixture

`fixtures/model-view.html?variant=<name>` renders a real loader result (`loadBbmodel` on a formats test fixture,
imported statically; the URL only picks one of the variants below, looked up as an own key) with one fixed camera,
light and look (`fixtures/src/modelViewCamera.ts`), in two independent ways that read the same material table and
shading include:

- `raster`: an orthographic depth-only pass from the light (DEPTH_COMPONENT24, 1024², alpha-tested, slope polygon
  offset, back faces of single-sided runs culled as seen from the light), then the camera pass with the same culling,
  alpha discard, a `gl_FrontFacing` normal flip and a hard shadow-map lookup, into its own RGBA8 +
  DEPTH_COMPONENT24 target (blitted to the canvas; the default depth buffer may have only 16 bits). Its fragment depth
  is the scene format's render-order key (view depth − (order + back) × TIE, back = −1/16 for a back face) over
  `DEPTH_RANGE` (far + 1), computed per fragment from the pixel's ray and the triangle's plane (three flat corner
  attributes) by `shaders/include/cameraRay.glsl`, the same code the raycast uses, with a `LESS` test; no polygon
  offset. Interpolated positions or depths are not precise enough for the 0.001 tie (the rasteriser's error at a
  grazing angle is several times larger), which is why the fixture writes `gl_FragDepth` and gives up early-z: it is a
  reference, not a renderer; `@modelshot/renderer-rt` realises the key its own way (realtime-renderer.md).
- `raycast`: per pixel centre, a camera ray to the nearest triangle whose texel passes the alpha test
  (single-sided triangles only from the front; the smallest render-order key wins, the same key), shaded with the barycentric vertex normal, then one shadow ray toward the light that an
  alpha-passing
  triangle blocks (a single-sided one only if its front faces the light). Triangles and their vertex normals live in
  an RGBA32F data texture (at most 256, checked against `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`).

Textures are decoded with `createImageBitmap(…, { premultiplyAlpha: 'none', colorSpaceConversion: 'none' })`,
uploaded unflipped and unpremultiplied into a NEAREST `TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY` without mipmaps, and read back; a
partially transparent texel under a blended material fails the page with a clear error (partial alpha is drawn by the
product renderers, MS-14 and MS-17). Shaders are static `.glsl` files joined by `fixtures/src/shaderSource.ts`
(`#version` line, then `#define`s, then includes from `shaders/include/`, then the stage). Every constant the
shaders share with TypeScript (`MAX_MATERIALS`, `MODE_*`, `RENDER_ORDER_TIE`, `SHADOW_NORMAL_OFFSET`,
`DEPTH_RANGE`) is such a `#define` from
`fixtures/src/modelShaderDefines.ts`, so it has one source; a model with more materials or textures than the tables
hold fails with a clear error.

The page publishes `probes`: pixels of chosen texels of the cutout plane (and of their shadows on the ground,
following the light ray) and of the plane seen from behind, with the texel colour. `modelView.spec.ts` checks that the
opaque texel shows the plane, the transparent texel shows the ground, the ground under the transparent texel is lit
and under the opaque one shadowed, the back side shows the same texel at its mirrored place, and on the flat cube
(two coincident single-sided faces) light through a hole of the face toward the light reaches the ground while an
opaque texel of it shadows it. In `render-order`, two pairs of coincident quads (split along different diagonals, so
their depths differ by rounding only) show the higher order's texel: `in_front` over `default`, `default` over
`behind`; two more pairs face the eye with the `in_front` quad farther along the view by 2 × and 0.5 ×
`RENDER_ORDER_TIE_DISTANCE`: at 2 × the nearer `default` quad shows, at 0.5 × the `in_front` one.

Shadow receivers: both renderers move the receiving point `SHADOW_NORMAL_OFFSET` (1.5 shadow-map texels, 0.094
units) along its geometric normal toward the viewer before testing the light (shadow-map lookup or shadow-ray
origin). Without it the shadow map's own depth error made a dithered acne band on the grazing-lit smooth arch of
`mesh-shapes` (about 45 pixels, raster only); the offset is far below a texel of any fixture model, and the alpha-plane
shadow probes still pass.

**Pair tests**: the raster and raycast images of each model are compared with its `MODEL_VIEW_PAIR_TOLERANCE`
entry (`threshold 0.1` throughout); the test prints `[model-view pair] <model>: … px differ, ratio … / max …, mean
delta … / max …` into the build log and attaches it. Measured on SwiftShader (local Windows dev machine,
deterministic, same on re-runs), differing pixels of 65 536:

| model          | measured: pixels, ratio, mean delta | limit: `maxDiffRatio`, `maxMeanDelta` |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `alpha-plane`  | 115, 0.00175, 0.119                 | 0.0025, 0.25                          |
| `mesh-shapes`  | 50, 0.00076, 0.046                  | 0.001, 0.07                           |
| `render-order` | 40, 0.00061, 0.040                  | 0.0008, 0.06                          |

The differing pixels are isolated: pixels whose centre lies within a rounding error of a silhouette, of a shadow edge
(shadow-map texels against exact shadow rays; the longest is the straight edge of the arch's shadow on the checker
quad in `mesh-shapes`), or of a texel boundary on a gradient texture (the raster interpolates UVs per pixel, the
raycast takes exact barycentrics; adjacent `uv-grid.png` texels differ by about 13 levels after lighting). No region
differs as a whole. The measured values of a run are also in
`tools/harness/test-results/model-view-pair-<model>.json`. Dropping the alpha test from the shadow pass alone changes
about 2 000 pixels of `alpha-plane`, dropping the render-order term from the raster depth about 3 400 of
`render-order`; a tolerance is never widened to make a pair pass.

## Budgets

`budgets.json` (root, `"version": 1`) holds `max` values for frame time, time to 64 samples and gzip bundle size of
`app` and `embed`. `pnpm test` measures them (`bench.spec.ts`; the bundle is built fresh into a temporary directory, so
it does not depend on `pnpm -r build`) and fails when a value exceeds its `max`, when a budget has no measurement, or
a measurement has no budget. The measured values are in `tools/harness/test-results/budgets-measured.json`, and
every run prints each one against its max (`[budget] <group>.<key>: measured … / max …`, from `bench.spec.ts` and
`test/bundleSize.test.ts`; Vitest runs with `silent: false` so passing tests print too).

Measured on the local Windows dev machine (SwiftShader, 3 runs) when the budgets were set: frame time median 0.3, 0.3,
0.4 ms; time to 64 samples median 23.8, 23, 25.8 ms; gzip app 437 B, embed 115 B.

`frameTimeMs.rt-bench-512` is the realtime renderer on the benchmark scene (`fixtures/src/benchScene.ts`: 16 x 16 x 8
textured cubes, 2,048 cubes, 24,576 triangles, one mesh per cube in 128 group nodes of 4 x 4 cubes as the Blockbench
loader produces a grouped model, so 512 draw calls per frame after batching per node (checked by the spec), every
seventh with a partial-alpha face; 512 x 512, 4x MSAA, front and back face passes, opaque and transparency passes),
median of 30 frames after 5 warm-up frames. Local SwiftShader medians 68.9, 70.2 and 80.7 ms (3 runs, 128 group
nodes batched per node); max 750 ms is 10x the middle run (702 ms), rounded up, room for a CI runner that is 3-5x slower than the dev machine. SwiftShader cannot
stand in for a laptop GPU: the 60 fps criterion is evidenced by a manual run of the `fps=1` page on real hardware
(16.7 ms or less of frame work), recorded with the machine and GPU in the task.

`frameTimeMs.rt-load-first-frame-200k-order` times `setScene` plus the first frame of a generated scene at the
loader's limits (100 000 quads, 200 000 triangles, 400 000 vertices) at render order 1, which builds the exact key's
de-indexed geometry and its shared-edge flags at upload: local SwiftShader 348, 344 and 354 ms before the flags, 506
and 527 ms with them; since round 7 436 and 447 ms; max 3500 ms (10x of the first measurement).

`frameTimeMs.rt-bench-order-512` is the same scene with one mesh at render order 1, so every frame uses the exact
depth key (fragment depth, de-indexed geometry); max 750 ms like the raster bench. MS-12 local SwiftShader medians:
`rt-bench-512` 92, 118 and 120 ms (raster key, cubes double-sided as the loader marks free-format faces, coverage per
texel tap), `rt-bench-order-512` 117, 145 and 148 ms with MSAA, 83 and 107 ms since exact frames draw single-sampled
(MS-12 round 7).

- `frameTimeMs` max 5: the median is below 1 ms and `performance.now` is coarsened to 0.1 ms without cross-origin
  isolation, so 5x the median (2 ms) would be 20 ticks and one GC pause from flaking on a shared runner. 5 ms is 12-16x the
  local median and still catches about 12x and above over the local median.
- `timeToSamplesMs` max 300: about 3.7x the CI median (80.6 ms) and 12x the worst local median (25.8 ms); the first limit of 150 left under 2x on shared runners.
- `bundleGzipBytes` app 2500, embed 2200: measured plus about 2 kB, so a real dependency shows up while noise does not.

First CI run (2026-10-20, ubuntu-latest): frame time 0.9 ms (max 5, 5.5x), time to 64 samples 80.6 ms (max 300), gzip app 437 B, embed 115 B.
Limits derive from the CI numbers: re-derive from the `budgets-measured.json` artefact, with the numbers in the commit.
Changing a `max` is a reviewed change: explain it in the commit with the measured numbers, never raise it to hide a
regression.
